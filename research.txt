"Heraldic language is most concise, and it is always minutely exact, definite, and explicit; all unnecessary words are omitted, and all repetitions are carefully avoided; and, at the same time, every detail is specified with absolute precision. The nomenclature is equally significant, and its aim is to combine definitive exactness with a brevity that is indeed laconic.[4]"

"A given coat of arms may be drawn in many different ways, all considered equivalent and faithful to the blazon, just as the letter "A" may be printed in many different fonts while still being the same letter. For example, the shape of the escutcheon is almost always immaterial, with very limited exceptions (e.g., the coat of arms of Nunavut, for which a round shield is specified).

With the growth of heraldry, charges of a more pictorial and symbolic nature were adopted, including birds, lions, boars, leaves, weapons, crescents, stars (called mullets), and scallops (escallops).  Practically any object, animate or inanimate, can be and has been used as a heraldic charge.


Arms can be used to show marriage alliances, the holding of two or more lordships or the acquiring of important offices by the arms holder.  This is done by the practice or marshalling, which takes two forms.  Impaling is dividing a shield down the middle and having each side show the original coat of arms in its entirety.  Quartering is the division of a shield into two or more parts; an extreme example of this is the coat and crest of Lloyd of Stockton, which contains some 350 quarterings.
